## Description

pgpcord is a security-focused Vencord plugin that brings PGP encryption to your Discord communications.

## Guiding Principles

This project is governed by a strict set of principles to ensure user privacy and security.

- **Privacy-First**: No unencrypted data ever leaves the client.
- **User-Trust**: All key operations must be explicit and user-confirmed.
- **Zero-Trace**: Local storage must be encrypted; no plaintext logging.
- **Minimal-Backend**: The backend is for key exchange only, never message content.
